2. Goals and Objectives
Goals
The primary goal of the Stub Generator application is to provide a reliable and efficient tool for generating, storing, and retrieving API stub responses. This tool is essential for development and testing environments where dependencies might be unavailable or unstable. The Stub Generator aims to ensure seamless application functionality by simulating the behavior of external services.

Objectives
Interception and Storage of API Calls:

Intercept API calls made by the application and store the responses under specific subcomponent names. This allows the system to serve these stored responses when the actual dependencies are down.
Manual Data Input:

Provide a user-friendly interface to manually input and store stub data. This is particularly useful for creating custom responses for testing edge cases and scenarios that might be difficult to reproduce with actual external services.
Seamless Integration:

Ensure easy integration of the stub generator into existing systems. The provided interceptor file should be straightforward to include in any system to start intercepting and managing API calls immediately.
High Availability and Reliability:

Maintain high availability of stub responses to ensure that development and testing can proceed without interruptions even when external services are unavailable.
Scalability:

Design the stub generator to handle a large number of API calls and responses efficiently. This includes optimizing the storage and retrieval mechanisms to support high-performance requirements.
Security:

Implement robust security measures to protect the stored stub data from unauthorized access and tampering. This includes authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing and modifying stub data.
Extensibility:

Ensure the stub generator is easily extendable to support new features and functionalities as required. The architecture should be modular to allow for easy updates and enhancements.
Key Features
API Call Interception:
Capture and store API responses with minimal latency.

Stub Data Management:
Intuitive interface for managing stored stub data, including creating, updating, and deleting stubs.

Dependency Simulation:
Serve stub responses when actual dependencies are down, ensuring continued application functionality.

Logging and Monitoring:
Provide detailed logs and monitoring capabilities to track intercepted calls and stub usage.

Integration Ease:
Simple integration process with minimal configuration required for existing systems.

Conclusion
The Stub Generator application is designed to facilitate seamless development and testing processes by providing a reliable alternative when external dependencies are unavailable. By focusing on easy integration, robust data management, and high performance, the Stub Generator aims to be an indispensable tool for developers and testers.

This section can be included in your documentation to clearly outline the goals and objectives of your Stub Generator application, providing a comprehensive understanding of its purpose and key features.
